**Developer:** GitHub Copilot Agent

---

## Overview

Implemented a complete, modern Results workspace with list view, stats panel, and enhanced detail page with reason tagging, coverage tracking, category analysis, and personal notes.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 🎯 Backend (Server)

#### 1. **Reason Codes System**

- **File:** `server/src/utils/reasonCodes.js`
- **Purpose:** Standardized taxonomy of 7 mistake reasons (Misread, Inference Gap, Vocab Confusion, etc.)
- **Spec Reference:** Section 1.1

#### 2. **Schema Extensions**

- **File:** `server/src/models/Attempt.js`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `wrongReasons` array field with `{ questionIndex, code, createdAt }`
  - Added `isPersonalBest` boolean field
  - Imported `REASON_CODES` for enum validation
- **Spec Reference:** Sections 1.2, 6.1

#### 3. **New API Endpoints**

##### GET `/api/v1/attempts` - List User Attempts

- **Controller:** `attempt.controller.js` → `listUserAttempts()`
- **Features:**
  - Pagination support (page, limit query params)
  - Populates RC title only (performance optimization)
  - Returns formatted attempts with score, duration, personal best flag
  - Sorts by most recent first
- **Response Example:**

```json
{
  "attempts": [
    {
      "_id": "abc123",
      "rcPassage": { "_id": "rc1", "title": "The Evolution of Language" },
      "score": 3,
      "correctCount": 3,
      "totalQuestions": 4,
      "durationSeconds": 754,
      "attemptedAt": "2025-10-05T14:30:00Z",
      "isPersonalBest": true
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "currentPage": 1,
    "totalPages": 5,
    "totalAttempts": 48
  }
}
```

##### PATCH `/api/v1/attempts/:id/reasons` - Capture Reason

- **Controller:** `attempt.controller.js` → `captureReason()`
- **Features:**
  - Validates reason code against REASON_CODES enum
  - Validates questionIndex in range
  - Idempotent (overwrites existing reason for same questionIndex)
  - Auth check (user must own attempt)
- **Request Body:**

```json
{
  "questionIndex": 2,
  "code": "INFERENCE_GAP"
}
```

- **Spec Reference:** Section 1.4

##### PATCH `/api/v1/attempts/:id/analysis-notes` - Save Analysis Notes

- **Controller:** `attempt.controller.js` → `saveAnalysisNotes()`
- **Features:**
  - Validates max length (2000 chars)
  - Auth check (user must own attempt)
  - Returns saved notes
- **Request Body:**

```json
{
  "analysisNotes": "I need to slow down on inference questions..."
}
```

- **Spec Reference:** Section 4.4

#### 4. **Routes Updated**

- **File:** `server/src/routes/attempts.js`
- **New Routes:**
  - `GET /` → `listUserAttempts`
  - `PATCH /:id/reasons` → `captureReason`
  - `PATCH /:id/analysis-notes` → `saveAnalysisNotes`

  - Expand/collapse functionality for incorrect questions
  - Real-time wrongReasons state tracking
- **Route:** `/analysis/:id`

---

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. **Reuse Dashboard Bundle for Stats**

- **Why:** Akash already implemented `/users/me/dashboard` with attempts7d and accuracy7d
- **Implementation:** ResultsPage fetches dashboard bundle and supplements with client-side coverage calculation
- **Future:** Move to centralized analytics service (Spec 2.1) when needed

### 2. **Separate List and Detail Pages**

- **List:** `/results` → Shows all attempts with stats panel
- **Detail:** `/analysis/:id` → Enhanced detail view with full features
- **Why:** Follows spec's recommendation and provides clear navigation hierarchy

### 3. **Client-Side Coverage Calculation**

- **Why:** Coverage needs to be computed from recent attempts on list page
- **Future:** Move to backend when implementing weekly reason summary endpoint (Spec 1.7)

### 4. **Collapsed Questions by Default**

- **Why:** Spec 4.2 - Performance optimization + reduced visual overwhelm
- **Implementation:** Lazy-mount explanation + reason selector on expand

### 5. **Category Stats from q_details**

- **Why:** Akash already implemented per-question metadata in q_details array
- **Implementation:** Helper function aggregates by qCategory field

## Testing Checklist

### Backend

- [ ] `GET /api/v1/attempts` returns paginated list
- [ ] `PATCH /api/v1/attempts/:id/reasons` validates code and questionIndex
- [ ] `PATCH /api/v1/attempts/:id/reasons` is idempotent (overwrites existing)
- [ ] `PATCH /api/v1/attempts/:id/analysis-notes` validates max length
- [ ] Auth checks work (403 if not attempt owner)
- [ ] Error responses match spec format

### Frontend

- [ ] ResultsPage loads and displays stats panel
- [ ] ResultsPage shows paginated attempts list
- [ ] Clicking attempt card navigates to detail page
- [ ] Pagination works (Previous/Next buttons)
- [ ] Analysis page shows hero score card
- [ ] Coverage meter displays correctly
- [ ] Reason tag dropdown saves and shows checkmark
- [ ] Incorrect questions collapse/expand
- [ ] Category accuracy table sorts correctly
- [ ] Analysis notes auto-save with debounce
- [ ] Personal best badge shows on highest score
- [ ] Skeleton loaders display while fetching
- [ ] Empty states show appropriate messages
- [ ] Error handling shows toast notifications

### Integration

- [ ] End-to-end flow: Complete attempt → View in list → Click → See detail → Tag reason → Write notes
- [ ] Coverage % updates when reasons are tagged
- [ ] Category stats populate from q_details
- [ ] Personal best logic works (need backend implementation in submitAttempt)

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### 1. **Personal Best Logic**

- **Status:** Schema field added but detection logic NOT implemented
- **What's Missing:** In `submitAttempt` controller, need to:
  1. Query user's previous attempts
  2. Compare new score to max score
  3. Set `isPersonalBest = true` if higher
  4. Unset previous personal best
- **Spec Reference:** Section 6.1
- **Priority:** Medium (cosmetic feature)

### 2. **Coverage Calculation on Backend**

- **Current:** Client-side calculation from attempts list
- **Future:** Add `GET /api/users/me/reasons/week` endpoint (Spec 1.7)
- **Benefits:** Consistent calculation, powers dashboard widget

### 3. **Dashboard Reason Summary Widget**

- **Status:** Not implemented (out of scope for Results workspace)
- **Spec Reference:** Section 1.8
- **Dependencies:** Needs `GET /api/users/me/reasons/week` endpoint

### 4. **Analytics Service Centralization**

- **Current:** Direct aggregation in controllers
- **Future:** Create `server/src/services/analytics.service.js` with LRU cache
- **Spec Reference:** Section 2.1
- **Benefits:** Performance optimization, DRY principle

### 5. **Toast Notifications**

- **Current:** Uses existing Toast component
- **Enhancement:** Could add coverage milestone toasts (Spec 1.6)
- **Example:** "Great reflection session — tagging accelerates improvement!"

   - Add logic to compare scores and update `isPersonalBest` flag

4. **Add Coverage Milestone Toasts**

   - In Analysis page, detect coverage increase
   - Show toast if increase >= 10%

5. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with 50+ attempts in list
   - Verify pagination performance
   - Check debounced save doesn't spam API

## Developer Notes

### Design Patterns Used

1. **Optimistic UI Updates** - Reason tags and notes save immediately in UI, rollback on error
2. **Debounced Saves** - Notes textarea waits 800ms before API call
3. **Skeleton Loading States** - Prevents layout shift and improves perceived performance
4. **Component Variants** - AttemptScoreCard has `compact` and `hero` modes
5. **Idempotent APIs** - Reason capture overwrites existing, safe to retry
6. **Lazy Mounting** - Incorrect question details only mount on expand

### Code Quality

- ✅ All components follow existing patterns (Card, Button, Badge)
- ✅ Consistent error handling with try/catch + toast notifications
- ✅ Semantic token usage for colors (success-green, error-red, etc.)
- ✅ Accessible markup (ARIA labels where appropriate)
- ✅ Responsive design (grid stacks on mobile)
- ✅ TypeScript-ready (explicit prop types in JSDoc comments would help future conversion)
