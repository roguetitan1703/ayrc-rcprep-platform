### **Project ARC: Core Mission & Vision Document**

Version: 1.0

Date: August 24, 2025

#### **1\. Executive Summary**

ARC (Ace Reading Comprehension) is a focused, habit-forming digital platform designed to solve the most persistent problem for CAT aspirants in India: mastering the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC) section. It provides two authentic, CAT-level RC passages with expert-crafted questions and detailed analysis every single day. ARC transforms vague advice into a structured, measurable, and affordable daily practice, empowering users to turn their biggest weakness into their greatest strength.

#### **2\. The Core Problem: "Just Read More" is Broken Advice**

Every CAT aspirant is told to "read a lot." This advice is well-intentioned but fundamentally flawed for three reasons:

* **Untested Comprehension:** Simple reading doesn't build skill. Without testing, an aspirant never knows if they truly understood the nuances of a complex passage.  
* **Difficulty Mismatch:** Most readily available articles are far below the linguistic and logical complexity of a real CAT exam. This creates a false sense of confidence.  
* **Unreliable Questions:** There is no trusted, consistent source of high-quality, exam-style questions and, more importantly, detailed explanations for self-studying aspirants.

ARC exists to fix this broken loop.

#### **3\. The Target User: The Ambitious Aspirant**

Our user is a highly motivated, digitally-savvy CAT aspirant in India.

* They are **driven and disciplined**, either self-studying or supplementing expensive coaching classes.  
* They are **pragmatic**, valuing tangible results and measurable progress over vague promises.  
* They are **frustrated** by the lack of focused, high-quality practice tools for VARC that fit into a daily schedule.  
* They are preparing for a high-stakes, incredibly competitive exam and are looking for every possible edge.

#### **4\. The ARC Solution & Value Proposition**

We bridge the gap between passive reading and active mastery. Our promise is simple: **20 minutes a day for measurable improvement.**

* **Laser-Focus on Daily RC Practice:** We do one thing, and we do it better than anyone else. Two passages, eight questions, every day.  
* **Guaranteed CAT-Level Difficulty:** Our passages are meticulously curated to match the complexity and style of the actual CAT exam. No more guesswork.  
* **Expert-Crafted Questions & Explanations:** The analysis is as important as the test. Every incorrect option is a potential trap, and we explain why, building deep comprehension skills.  
* **A Familiar, Exam-Like Environment:** Our "Deep Focus" theme and test interface are designed to mimic the real exam, reducing anxiety and building confidence for test day.

#### **5\. Guiding Principles for Development**

These are the core philosophies that must guide every implementation decision.

* **Focus Over Features:** Every element on the screen must serve the primary goal of focused reading and analysis. If it's a distraction, it doesn't belong. This is why our design is minimal and dark-themed.  
* **Build the Habit:** The platform's core loop is designed to be a daily ritual. Features like streaks and a clear "Today's Practice" section are paramount.  
* **Clarity and Trust:** The user must trust our content. Explanations must be unambiguous, data must be accurate, and the platform must be reliable.  
* **Developer, Be Paranoid:** Proactively address edge cases. Think about empty states, error handling, and logical gaps. A robust user experience is a non-negotiable feature.

#### **6\. Definition of MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**

To maintain focus, the scope of this initial build is sharply defined.

* **IN SCOPE:** The complete user flow (Registration, Login, Dashboard, Test, Results, Analysis, Feedback), the core stat tracking (Streak, Accuracy), and the full Admin Panel for content management.  
* **OUT OF SCOPE:** Payment processing and subscription plans, full Verbal Ability sections (Para Jumbles, etc.), advanced gamification (badges, leaderboards), and adaptive difficulty.
