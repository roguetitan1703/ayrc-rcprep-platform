# ARC (Ace Reading Comprehension)

MERN-based MVP implementing the ARC blueprints: daily CAT-level RCs, admin CMS, and user practice flows.

This repo contains two apps:

- `server/` — Node.js + Express + MongoDB API
- `client/` — React (Vite) + Tailwind UI

Source of truth: see `Implementation-docs/`.

## Getting Started

Backend

- Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and fill values.
- From `server/`, run `npm run dev`.

Frontend

- After scaffolding `client/` (Vite + Tailwind), run `npm run dev`.
